  <h1>Lions</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Lions are large cats known for their majestic manes and powerful roars. They are native to Africa and parts of Asia and are the second-largest living cat species after tigers.</p>
  <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
  <p>Male lions are larger than females and can weigh up to 550 pounds. They have a distinctive mane of long hair around their head and neck, which helps protect them in fights. Female lions do not have manes, but they are still strong and agile hunters. Both males and females have retractable claws and sharp teeth, which they use to catch and kill their prey.</p>
  <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
  <p>Lions are found in a variety of habitats including grasslands, savannas, and woodlands. They prefer areas with plenty of prey and access to water. In the past, lions were found across much of Africa, Europe, and Asia, but today their range is much smaller and they are mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa and a few isolated populations in India.</p>
  <h2>Behavior and Diet</h2>
  <p>Lions are social animals and live in groups called prides, which can consist of up to 30 individuals. The pride is led by a dominant male and females do most of the hunting. Lions are carnivorous and primarily hunt large mammals such as antelopes, zebras, and wildebeest. They are also known to scavenge for food and will sometimes steal kills from other predators.</p>
  <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
  <p>Lions are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Their populations have declined significantly due to habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans. Efforts are being made to protect lions and their habitats, but more work is needed to ensure their long-term survival.</p>
