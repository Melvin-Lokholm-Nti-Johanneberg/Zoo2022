  <h1>Tigers</h1>
  <p>Tigers are large cats native to Asia. They are known for their distinctive orange and black stripes, which help them blend in with the tall grasses and forests of their habitat.</p>
  <h2>Physical characteristics</h2>
  <p>Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and can reach up to 11 feet in length and weigh up to 660 pounds. They have strong, muscular bodies and are powerful hunters, able to take down large prey with their sharp claws and teeth. Tigers have excellent eyesight and are able to see six times better in the dark than humans.</p>
  <h2>Behavior and habitat</h2>
  <p>Tigers are solitary animals, only coming together to mate or to raise their young. They are most active at dawn and dusk and are excellent swimmers. Tigers are found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and swamps. They are primarily found in Asia, with smaller populations in Russia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
  <h2>Conservation</h2>
  <p>Unfortunately, tigers are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. There are currently only around 4,000 tigers left in the wild, with several different subspecies facing extinction. Conservation efforts are underway to protect tigers and their habitats, and it is important for us to do our part to help preserve these magnificent animals.</p>
