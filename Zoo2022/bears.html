  <h1>Bears</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Bears are large carnivorous mammals found in various parts of the world. There are eight bear species in total, including polar bears, brown bears, and black bears. Bears are known for their strong bodies, sharp claws, and excellent senses of smell and hearing.</p>
  <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
  <p>Bears vary in size and appearance depending on the species. Polar bears are the largest bear species and can weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Brown bears, which include grizzly bears and Kodiak bears, are also large and can weigh up to 1,000 pounds. Black bears are the smallest bear species and can weigh up to 600 pounds. All bears have thick fur coats, sharp claws, and powerful bodies adapted for climbing and digging.</p>
  <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
  <p>Bears are found in a variety of habitats including forests, tundra, and grasslands. Polar bears are found in the Arctic region, brown bears are found in North America, Europe, and Asia, and black bears are found in North America. Some bear species, such as the American black bear, have a wide range, while others, such as the Giant Panda, have a more restricted range.</p>
  <h2>Behavior and Diet</h2>
  <p>Bears are generally solitary animals, but they may come together in groups to mate or to feed on a particularly abundant food source. Bears are omnivorous and have a varied diet that includes fruits, vegetables, insects, and small mammals. Some bear species, such as polar bears and grizzly bears, also hunt larger animals such as seals and caribou.</p>
  <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
  <p>Several bear species are classified as vulnerable or endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Threats to bear populations include habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans. Efforts are being made to protect bears and their habitats, but more work is needed to ensure their long-term survival.</p>
